#  Market Price Analysis & Visualization

## Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis and visualization on supermarket price data.
The dataset was analyzed in the context of a governmental initiative aimed at monitoring and controlling price variations across major supermarket chains.

## Analytical Objective
Analyze price-related data from major supermarket chains to identify patterns, trends, and anomalous price behaviors.

## Commercial Context
The government requested the use of major supermarket chains as reference points to conduct a price control analysis.
A subset of 15 product- and price-related variables was selected to support this study.

## Dataset
- Large-scale dataset with product and pricing information
- Includes numerical and categorical variables
- Data was filtered and cleaned for analytical purposes

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The analysis includes:
- Univariate analysis using histograms (data frequency)
- Boxplots for outlier detection
- Aggregations by supermarket
- Price comparisons across chains

## Key Insights
- Price distributions show skewness and high variability
- Several outliers were detected in numerical variables
- Supermarket-level aggregation highlights differences in pricing strategies

## Future Work
- Outlier treatment using statistical methods
- Feature engineering and normalization
- Anomaly detection using machine learning techniques
