# Data Processing and Exploration Pipeline

This project aims to explore, evaluate, and process potential datasets for real-world use cases using Python.  
It includes an initial assessment of data quality, exploratory analysis, and visualization, with a focus on **data processing, structure, and reliability**.

The project is designed to demonstrate practical skills relevant to **Data Engineer Junior / Backend Data** roles.

---

## Objectives

- Identify datasets with analytical potential and business value.
- Evaluate data structure, quality, and relevant variables.
- Perform exploratory data analysis using Pandas.
- Apply data transformations to prepare clean and structured datasets.
- Document the data processing workflow in a clear and reproducible way.

## Datasets

Three datasets were analyzed, obtained from public sources such as **Kaggle, GitHub, and Google Dataset Search**.

For each dataset, the following steps were performed:
- Data loading using Pandas.
- Structural analysis (`info`, `describe`).
- Data quality checks and missing value detection.
- Identification of relevant variables based on the dataset context.

One dataset was selected for deeper exploration and visualization.

---

## Visualizations

For the selected dataset, visualizations were created using:
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

The charts help identify distributions, patterns, and relationships between variables, supporting a better understanding of the data and its potential use in downstream processes.

## Results

This project demonstrates:
- Data processing and exploration using Pandas.
- Structured and methodical handling of datasets.
- Ability to prepare clean data for further analysis or pipeline integration.
- Good documentation and project organization practices.
